# QandAChatBot

This is a Question and Answer chatbot developed by me using openai api key. You need to have the secret_key i.e., api_key from openai and use it in the code in place of api_key in order to run it. Also make sure to fulfill all requirements specified in requirements.txt file.
The chatbot answers to any legal question you ask it. It uses the GPT 3.5 Turbo model in the backend and streamlit for final execution and deployment.
